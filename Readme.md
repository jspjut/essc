This repository is a html-based calculator for effective device screen size. It was made with the intent to compare iPad and Chromebook tablet screens for the intended use of reading standard American superhero comic book pages, but should be easy enough to adapt for other types of content. Find the live page [here](https://josef.spjut.me/essc/).

Most of the code was started by large language models (a mix of Perplexity Pro and ChatGPT as of June, 2024), but most of the actual calculator functionality needed to be cleaned up manually. I consider this source to be in the public domain. I take no liability for what it does.

If there's interest, maybe I'll share some of the prompt-response pairs.

I'm happy to take contributions of other screen types or use cases in case there are any you care about.

## Random notes

* Standard American Comic books are about 6.625" x 10.25"
* Digest size American Trade paperbacks are about 5.825" x 9.25", a reasonable lower-bound for comfortable text size.
* By my math, digest trade paperbacks are about 90% font scale of full-sized comic books (9.25"/10.25" vertical).
